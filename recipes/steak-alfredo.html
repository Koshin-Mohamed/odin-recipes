    <h3>Steak & Marinade</h3>
    <ul class="center">
        <li> 1½ cups Italian-style salad dressing </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
        <li> 2 pounds flat iron steak, cut into 3-inch squares </li>
        <li> 4 cups chopped fresh spinach </li>
        <li> 4 tablespoons crumbled Gorgonzola cheese, divided </li>
        <li> 1 pound dry fettuccine pasta </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons balsamic glaze </li>
        <li> Chopped fresh parsley, or as needed </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="center width">
        <li>Heat milk and cream in a saucepan over medium heat until simmering, about 5 minutes. Slowly whip in Parmesan and Romano cheeses and remove from heat. Whisk egg yolks together in a heat-proof bowl and slowly add about 1/4 cup of the hot sauce to temper eggs. Whisk egg mixture into the saucepan slowly. Season with salt and pepper. Allow Alfredo sauce to cool and refrigerate until needed.
        </li>
        <li>Combine salad dressing, rosemary, and lemon juice in a large bowl. Add steak and stir to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>When ready to prepare the meal, preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 2 cups refrigerated Alfredo sauce in a saucepan over medium heat. Add spinach and 2 tablespoons Gorgonzola cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Remove steak from marinade and cook on the preheated grill to desired doneness, 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Pour hot Alfredo sauce into a large serving bowl. Add cooked pasta and mix to combine. Sprinkle remaining Gorgonzola cheese on top. Add grilled steak and drizzle the meat with balsamic glaze. Garnish with parsley.
